# A Three-Tier Application on the Cloud

# esproj1
My first Services Engineering Project, from 2017. It consists of a small music hosting website, with all three layers(front-end, back-end and data) implemented. 

Technologies used:  
-React.js/HTML(front-end)  
-OpenAPI(REST Methods Interface)  
-Flask/Connexion(back-end).Connexion is an open source API created to use OpenAPI on top of Flask more easily. It is available at https://github.com/zalando/connexion  
-SQLAlchemy and MySQL(data-layer)  
-Amazon WebServices S3 and Elastic BeanStalk  

How to run it on AWS:  
1)replace the keys file with your own aws keys  
2)compress every file(including requirements.txt) in a zip folder named "application.zip"  
3)upload the file into an Elastic Beanstalk instance  



## Objectives:

-Create scalable and strictly divided three-tier enterprise applications

-Use the OpenAPI standard to expose REST services

-Learn to create JavaScript clients with React

-Use the Flask microframework to provide the web services

-Use an Object Relational Mapper, SQLAlchemy
